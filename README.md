# Description

This repo stores the website content for ChimeraOS as seen on [https://chimeraos.org/](https://chimeraos.org/).

This fork aims to make ChimeraOS more user-friendly by providing documentation in the form of easy-to-read user guides directly on the [Chimera OS website](https://chimeraos.org/), rather than in the wiki section of the project's github repo.

This provides several benefits:
- Easily discoverable by users with little to no experience of github.
- Easier for contributors to maintain and quickly update user documentation compared to the wiki function leading to better and up-to-date docs
